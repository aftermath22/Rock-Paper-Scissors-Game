* This is a simple rock paper scissors game made with HTML-CSS-Javascript where you play against the computer which generates random choices.


* This project deemed to be fruitful to learn how to make an interactive website with the help of Javascript.


* Features Inclued :
  1. Rock paper and scissors can be chosen by clicking the respective icons as well as by pressing "1","2" and "3" on the keyboard respectively.
  2. The results (wins,loses and ties) are stored in local storage which aids in saving the results even if the website is reloaded or the browser is closed.The score can be reset by clicking the 'Reset Button'.
  3. There is an 'Auto Play' feature where both the inputs are randomly generated by the computer each game is played in an interval of 1 second. This helps us in realizing the mechanism of setInterval method of Javascript.The game will continue until the 'Auto Play' button is clicked again which clears the interval set earlier.


* This is how the Website Looks:
